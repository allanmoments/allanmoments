I’m a data engineer who enjoys turning messy data into systems people can actually trust. I spend most of my time working with Azure, GCP, and Python, building data platforms that are simple, scalable, and easy to maintain.

I care about clean architecture, automation, and using data to solve real problems, especially in education and healthcare. I like practical solutions, clear thinking, and tools that do the job without unnecessary complexity.
